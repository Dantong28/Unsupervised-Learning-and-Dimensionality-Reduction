Dantong Zhu CS 7641 project 3

Datasets:
The two datasets are both from UCI:
1. The forest fire dataset is available at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Forest+Fires.
2. The wine quality dataset is available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality, and we only used the red wine dataset for this project.

Code:
Code can be found at https://github.com/Dantong28/Unsupervised-Learning-and-Dimensionality-Reduction.

The code is implemented in a Python 3 jupyter notebook. All clustering and feature transformation algorithms are from sklearn. To run the code:
1. Download the datasets forestfiles.csv and winequality-red.csv from the links above.
2. Open ML Project 3 code.ipynb
3. In the second cell, change file_dir_ff and file_dir_wq to the directories for forestfiles.csv and winequality, respectively, on your computer.
4. Run the code.

Write-up:
dzhu37-analysis.pdf is my writeup.

Supplemental Materials:
1. In the Datasets folder, you can find the two datasets.
2. In the Plots folder, you can find all the plots, and most of them have been included in the writeup.
